\chapter{State of the art}
\label{chapter:state}

Being a large domain, deep learning imposes a research in multiple subdomains, neuroscience, reinforcement learning, neural networks and convolutional neural networks. That being said, this chapter is dedicated to gathering information on each of them.

\section{Reinforcement learning}
\label{sec:reinforcement}

\subsection{History}
The history of reinforcement learning starts with the pavlovian experiment\cite{pavlov} in 1903, when Pavlov tried to demonstrate that there is a connection between conditioned and unconditioned stimulus. The unconditioned response of salivation of a dog is fired up by bringing an unconditioned stimulus as food. If we try to make the dog to salivate in the presence of a neutral stimulus(the sound of a bell) we won't succeed, but if we use in the same time the unconditioned and neutral stimulus we can make the dog salivate and transform the bell and salivation in conditioned stimulus and conditioned response.
