Deep Learning is a new, interesting and a fast-growing field of Machine Learning. It combines the classical model of multilayer perceptrons with layers of feature extraction inspired from visual cortex of the brain. Moreover, dealing with the curse of dimensionality is another advantage when we talk about Convolutional Neural Networks. This paper proposes an alternative to the classical reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-Learning and SARSA. The question which arises is this: what if we make an agent and allow it to play a game based on information from visual frames and rewards recieved during the game?
