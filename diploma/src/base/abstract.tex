Deep Learning is a new, interesting and a fast-growing field of Machine Learning. A successful model for deep learning is represented by convolutional neural networks. They combine the classical model of multilayer perceptrons with layers of feature extraction inspired from visual cortex of the brain. Moreover, dealing with the curse of dimensionality is another advantage when we talk about convolutional neural networks. This paper proposes an improvement to the classical reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-Learning and SARSA which can lead to a good performance in combination with convolutional networks. The question which arises is this: what if we make an agent and allow it to play a game based on information from visual frames and rewards received during the game?
